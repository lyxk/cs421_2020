In INITIAL state, if a reserved word is encountered, return the corresponding token. If a double quote is encountered, 
enter the STRING state. If /* is encountered, enter the comment state. Otherwise, print error position and message.

Apart from INITIAL state, four additional states are defined.

1. STRING
Upon entering the STRING state, three things are done
    a. Set strMode to true
    b. Clear currString
    c. Save yypos to strStart
In STRING state, whenever a printable character or space is encountered, append it to currString. When \n or \t is
encountered, call err to print error position and message. If \ is read, enter STRING_ESCAPE state.

2. STRING_ESCAPE
In STRING_ESCAPE state (the first \ has already been read), n, t, \, ", ^c, ddd, f___f\ are permitted, otherwise 
print error position and message. For \^c and \ddd, calculate the corresponding ASCII code first, then use 
String.str( chr ( ascii_code ) ) to get the string and append to currString. If space or \n is encountered, enter
STRING_ESCAPE_MULTI state, which means the string can span multiple lines.

3. STRING_ESCAPE_MULTI
In STRING_ESCAPE_MULTI state, only \n and space are permitted, if \ is read, return back to STRING state. Everything
inside STRING_ESCAPE_MULTI state is ignored and not counted in the currString.

4. COMMENT
In COMMENT state, everything is ignored, until the next */ is read, ending the COMMENT state and return back to INITIAL.

EOF Handling

For EOF handling, since \n always preceeds EOF token, there is no need to check strMode again since \n will trigger error
in STRING state. The only check performed is whether COMMENT is closed, if not, print an error message, otherwise just
return EOF token.
