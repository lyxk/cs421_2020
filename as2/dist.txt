a. k = 3. To examine more than more than one character after an accepted state has been reached, that accepted state
must transitions to other states so that the automaton's current state will move forward while the last accepted 
state remain the same. Only state 5 satisfies this condition, after reaching state 5, at most 3 tokens may be read 
(e, +|-, [^0-9]) to use the last accepted state and restart the automaton. For example, 0e+a, 0e-a, 1e++ all satisfy
this condition.
b. 0e+a. After going through the parser, it will become 0, e, +, a.
